#This is an empty script that does nothing
#The tidydata script was moving files that the logger code
#hadn't finished writing. This was causing the logger code
#to crash. Hence I've moved the tidydata script to
#tidydata.orig and replaced it with this script that does
#nothing. This is not a big deal as the data doesn't
#really need tidying. See issue number 7 in the git
#instrument-log repo.
